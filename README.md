_**DEPRECATION NOTICE:**_

_**Times have changed and so has the need for this Ansible workstation configuration. I have used it with my team for over 4 years to have a very feature-rich development environment deployed on either Fedora Workstation or MacOS. Eventually we moved to using Docker Compose based configurations (like Warden), because the maintanence burden was getting quite high, especially for MacOS. This repository has been archived and should be seen as a library of all kinds of Ansible stuff.**_

Workstation Common

Common tasks for installing and configuring Fedora Workstation and MacOS. It's a development stack using:

- MariaDB
- Redis
- Dnsmasq
- Elasticsearch
- Mailcatcher

All the other sugar included, such as:
- Docker
- Google Chrome
- AWS CLI
- Composer
- Magerun
- Spotify
- Steam
- Many other tweaks.

This project is tested and running on:
- Fedora Workstation 33
- MacOS (**in development, tests need to be added**)
